# My Frontend development works
**Hello, my name is Ivan Pimanov, I'm a junior (IMHO) frontend developer. This repository has been created for potential employers. I uploaded my main projects here for demonstrated layout, JS and REACT skills, which I made. Thank you for your attention.  
Please see project descriptions below.**

## REACT
### **MIRROR REDDIT**
**https://mirror-redd-react.herokuapp.com/**  
My biggest SSR mobile responsive React and typescript project for viewing and managment posts from reddit.com.\

>Build package - `npm run build`;\
>Client will start in `http://localhost:3000`;

***Used tools: HTML, CSS, JS, React, TypeScript, Redux, Redux-Thunk, SSR, WebPack, OAuth2 reddit, eslint.***

## Vanilla JS projects

This is a SPA project on pure JS of an online bank that implements: creating new accounts, transferring funds, balance statistics, pseudo exchange rates, currency exchange.\
**Used tools: HTML, SCSS, WebPack, eslint, jest, e2e.**
## Layout projects
### **BLANCHARD**
**http://blanchard.sbip.tmweb.ru/**  
That is my first layout single page project. This is a simple project with high-quality adaptive layout, as well as a form submission function with a minimum of js and even without preprocessors as SASS. Here I used different plugins to create an accordion, slider, dropdown, tooltip, customization of elements etc.\
***Used tools: HTML, CSS.***

### **SITDOWNPLEASE**
**http://sitdownplease.sbip.tmweb.ru/**  
This is already an adaptive and crossbrowser multi-page site, but still not very functional. Here I used the layout and all the development tools to the fullest. The whole header is made on grids without duplicating code, you can see the permutation of elements with changing the screen size up to 320 pixels. JS at that time had not yet been studied, I used it intuitively (thanks to Google).\
The functional part is made on the "каталог" page, checkboxes and rageline work here
Active pages: "Каталог", "Контакты", any button "купить", in the footer "Поставщикам".\
***Used tools: HTML, SCSS, JS, GULP package managment.***
